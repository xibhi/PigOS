## 🔄 Post-Installation

After installation completes:

1. **Reboot your system** to start using SDDM and Hyprland:
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

2. **Select Hyprland** from the SDDM display manager login screen

3. **Customize your setup** by editing configuration files in `~/.config/`

4. **Add your own wallpapers** to `~/.config/assets/backgrounds/`

5. **Configure keybindings** in `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf` to match your preferences

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues

1. **Script fails with "Please run as root"**
   - Make sure you're running the script with `sudo ./install.sh`

2. **YAY installation fails**
   - Ensure you have `git` and `base-devel` installed
   - Check your internet connection
   - You may need to manually install YAY if the automated installation fails

3. **AUR package installation fails**
   - Some AUR packages may require manual intervention
   - Check the AUR page for the specific package for dependencies
   - You can manually install failed packages later using `yay -S <package-name>`

4. **OS detection warning**
   - The script is designed for Arch Linux
   - You can proceed anyway, but some packages may not be available on other distributions

### Runtime Issues

1. **Hyprland doesn't start**
   - Check logs: `journalctl -u hyprland` or `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.log`
   - Verify your graphics drivers are installed
   - Ensure you're using a Wayland-compatible setup

2. **Audio not working**
   - Check if Pipewire is running: `systemctl --user status pipewire`
   - Restart audio services: `systemctl --user restart pipewire`

3. **Network not working**
   - Check NetworkManager status: `systemctl status NetworkManager`
   - Use `nmcli` or `nmtui` to configure network connections

4. **Bluetooth not working**
   - Check bluetooth service: `systemctl status bluetooth`
   - Start bluetooth: `sudo systemctl start bluetooth`

5. **Configuration errors**
   - Check configuration syntax in `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`
   - Validate JSON in Waybar config: `~/.config/waybar/config.jsonc`
   - Review logs in `~/logs/hyprland_install.log`
